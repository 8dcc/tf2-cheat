*Linux cheat for Team Fortress 2 made in C.*

#+TOC: headlines 2

* Deprecated. Note about =x86_64=.

I decided to continue the development of the 64-bit version of the cheat
privately. I don't want to spend time upgrading and fixing the whole project so
people can use it for making bots or selling a cheat.

I made this project because I enjoyed reversing the game in a platform with not
much reference, and I enjoy the low level aspect of programming the
cheat. The "cheating" part is not my main goal, and I publish this projects for
people who might find the code itself useful. I believe the current state of the
project serves that purpose.

If you just want to cheat on TF2, search somewhere else.

* Features

You can see the full list of features in [[./FEATURES.org][FEATURES.org]].

* Dependencies

We need the 32 bit SDL2 and GLEW libraries for linking the final shared object.

Arch-based distros:

#+begin_src bash
# Enable the [multilib] repository in /etc/pacman.conf, then pacman should pull
# the 32-bit gcc libraries.
$ sudo pacman -S lib32-glibc lib32-sdl lib32-glew
#+end_src

Debian-based distros:

#+begin_src console
$ sudo apt install libglew-dev:i386 libsdl2-dev:i386 gcc-multilib
#+end_src

The cheat uses the [[https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette][Cozette Vector]] font for rendering using =ISurface=. You can
install it with with the following command.

Arch-based (With [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cozette-ttf][AUR]] helper):

#+begin_src console
$ yay -S cozette-ttf  # Has to be ttf
#+end_src

Arch-based (Without AUR helper):

#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/cozette-ttf.git
$ cd cozette-ttf
$ makepkg -si
#+end_src

Manually (other distros):

#+begin_src console
$ wget https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette/releases/download/v.1.22.2/CozetteFonts-v-1-22-2.zip
$ unzip CozetteFonts-v-1-22-2.zip
$ cp -R CozetteFonts /usr/share/fonts/truetype
$ fc-cache
#+end_src

* Building

Simply clone the repository and build the project using =make=.

#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://github.com/8dcc/tf2-cheat
$ cd tf2-cheat
$ make -j$(nproc)
...
#+end_src

* Injecting

Uses the [[https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gdb/index.html][gdb]] debugger for injecting the library.

#+begin_src console
$ sudo ./injector.sh
[sudo] password for username:

...

Done. Unload cheat using:
./inject.sh unload ...
#+end_src
