* Notes
- All the "Player" settings also apply to MvM bots.
- Currently the menu has no "Keybinds" option, so if you want to change the
  aimbot or meleebot keybinds, you need to do one of these:
  1. Change the keycodes for each config by editing the JSON directly. The
     options are called =aim_keycode= and =melee_keycode=. You can find the
     keycodes [[https://github.com/8dcc/tf2-cheat/blob/ac8c9bd6ff10526d683b60bbf4346067b42227e1/src/dependencies/nuklear/nuklear.h#L305-L340][here]].
  2. Change the default keycodes from the code: [[https://github.com/8dcc/tf2-cheat/blob/2b0a9c2789b87a9c71cc3c62dcb28237fcd0cd20/src/include/settings.h#L8-L15][src/include/settings.h]]
- If the aimbot/meleebot keycode is 0, it will use mouse1 (=IN_ATTACK=) as key.
  This means that the aimbot will auto-shoot when holding mouse1 and will not
  attack if there is no target. This can act as the old "Release attack if no
  valid target" setting.
